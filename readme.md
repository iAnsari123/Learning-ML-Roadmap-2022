# **ML Roadmap 2022 📈 🤖**

## **Overview**
Welcome to my **ML Roadmap 2022**! 🚀  
This repository documents my journey toward becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer**, following a structured roadmap by **CampusX**. Along the way, I explore **statistics**, work on **hands-on projects**, and learn from diverse sources like **Datacamp** and **YouTube**.

Each folder contains code, datasets, and resources that help me solidify my understanding of concepts essential for Machine Learning and Data Science.
